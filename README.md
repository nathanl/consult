# Consult

NOTHING TO SEE HERE (yet).

## Aspirations

Consult lets you easily add live chat to a Phoenix app, where customers can get help from support staff.

## Requirements

Technically, Consult requires:

- Phoenix
- Ecto
- An Ecto-supported relational database (like PostgreSQL) and a few tables therein (see `mix consult.show_expected_structure`.

Also, Consult needs to know a little about your application. See the Configuration section below.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `consult` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:consult, "~> 0.0.1"}]
    end
    ```

  2. `mix deps.get`

  3.  Add `:consult` to your list of applications in `def application`.

##  Setup

### Tables

Consult requires some database tables for conversations, messages, and associated data.

Run `mix consult.show_expected_structure` to see an example migration that would add the tables it needs, then either create and run an identical migration, or write your own migration to make your schema match the one shown.

### Router and Endpoint

To your Phoenix routes file, add this:

```elixir
forward "/consult", Consult.Routes
```

To your Endpoint, add this:

```elixir
use Consult.Socket
```

### Configuration

In your Mix configuration (eg, `config.exs` or an environment-specific one), add lines like the following, referencing your own endpoint and ecto Repo modules:

```elixir
config :consult, :endpoint, MyApp.Endpoint
config :consult, :repo, MyApp.Repo
config :consult, :hooks_module, MyApp.ConsultHooks
config :consult, :presence_module, MyApp.Presence
```

Details below.

### Hooks Module

The hooks module referenced in the configuration must be defined in your application. It must define the following functions:

- `representative?(user)`
- `user_for_request(conn)`

#### - `representative?(user)

This function  accepts one of the user maps returned by `user_for_request(conn)` and returns a boolean. If it's true, the user will be allowed to answer incoming chats.

#### `user_for_request(conn)`

This function must must return a map or struct representing the user for the current request. Typically, this will mean checking the session, but your logic may vary. `user.id` and `user.name` are required fields, but both can have `nil` values if (for instance) the user is not logged in.

The user's id and name will be recorded in the database with any messages they send, and the name will be displayed in the chat box. If `user.name` is nil, a default value will be used. Since Consult can differentiate between someone starting a chat in the app vs one answering chats from the customer service dashboard, it gives them different default names accordingly ("User" and "Representative"). It also labels each message with the role "user" or "representative", regardless of the names used.

#### Hooks Module Implementation

Here's the simplest possible implementation of a hooks module:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ConsultHooks do

  def user_for_request(_conn) do
    # doesn't bother checking session, so
    # all chat users are anonymous
    %{id: nil, name: nil}
  end

  # 'user' is a return value from 'user_for_request'
  def representative?(_user) do
    # doesn't bother inspecting user, so all users
    # will be allowed to see and answer incoming user chats
    # in the customer support dashboard
    true
  end

end
```

#### Presence Module

Consult uses `Phoenix.Presence` to track which customer service representatives are watching the customer service dashboard. This allows Consult to push updates to each rep, customized for them - listing conversations they're handling separately from conversations other reps are handling.

You must have a presence module in your app and add it to your app's supervision tree, as shown [in the Presence docs](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html). Then tell Consult about your presence module by declaring it in your configuration, as shown above.

### Templates

Wherever you'd like to display a chatbox in your template, use:

```eex
<%= render Consult.ChatboxView, "_chatbox.html" %>
```

### Brunch and Assets

Note: this is the part that I understand least, because Brunch. ðŸ˜† But I think this will work.

In your Phoenix app's brunch config

- Add this to your `watched` section `"deps/consult/web/static"`
- To the `stylesheets.order` section, add `before: ["deps/consult/web/static/css/consult.css"]`

In your Javascript, do this:

```javascript
import {Socket} from "phoenix"
import {Consult} from "consult"
let consult = new Consult(Socket)
consult.enable()
```

## Usage

Users can start chats from anywhere you put the chat box.

Representatives can answer chats in the customer support dashboard at `/consult/conversations`.
